To run this program, you just need to have the 2 input files in the same folder, which are:
>> NAT.txt: records all the NAT matching
>> FLOW.txt: provides an input sequence
Their formats are equal to the requirement. Two sample files are included here as well.

Compile and run this program in a compiler. It'll read these 2 files and give the correct result automatically. The result will also be written into a newly created file in the same folder:
>> OUTPUT.txt
